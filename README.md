This project has been done to get used to Deep convolutional neural network.
Codes are done to try AlexNet, SimpleNet and SimplenetSlim with cifar10 dataset.
You can easily change architecture and dataset as you wish.


The curve folder permits to draw important graphs from text file extracted when you train your model
The model have been recreated with pruning to know how is the impact on it, and the size.py allows you to get the final size after pruning
